# Linumpy

**Linumpy** is the main library supporting research and development at the *Laboratoire d'Imagerie Num√©rique, Neurophotonique et Microscopie* ([LINUM]).

**Linumpy** contains tools and utilities to quickly work with serial histology and microscopy data. Those tools implement the recommended workflows and parameters used in the lab. 

## Installation
To install the tool for development, clone the repository and then install them with

```
pip install -e .
```

If the installation fails when building wheels for `asciitree`, define the following environment variable:
```
SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib
```
before running `pip install -e .` (see [issue #45](https://github.com/linum-uqam/linumpy/issues/45)).

To use the Napari viewer, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```
pip install napari[all]
``` 

We highly recommend working in a [Python Virtual Environment].
